                    <p class="visible-fadeIn">How cool are lasers? These lights that can literally burn stuff at a distance! Way cool. This project as born out of necessity for a tool that could cut and engrave thin plastics and wood. It also was a project for my Embeded systems class. The class was a good excuse to finally build this beautiful device. LaserCNC is a standalone custom hardware, design and software project with a powerfull 2W 445 nm laser diode. This enables the CNC to cut through most materials with ease. I have managed to cut balsa wood up to 7mm in thickness, this is plenty for most uses and provides a very handy, versile and fun to play with monster machine. </p>
                    <p class="visible-fadeIn">A custom PCB is a basis for my physical projects. This PCB is not the most complicated yet not the simplest of them all. It includes a micro SD card on the back of the unit, 5 buttons, headers for further expansion, 5 volt regulator and an atmega328p as the brains.  </p>

                    <p class="visible-fadeIn">The hardware for this project was very involved. First of, the electronics were composed of multiple seperate units, these included the main custom PCB, two stepper drivers and an LCD screen. Then there is the whole construction which enabled the CNC to move.</p>
                    <br>
                    <img class="img-rounded img-responsive visible-fadeIn" src="images/laser_cnc/electronics.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <p class="visible-fadeIn visible-fadeIn">The electronics were kept on seperate PCBs due to the fact that a single big PCB would cost a very large amount of money. The only way to get it cheap would be to go through China and unfortunately I did not have the time to do so, the class is only a semester long. On the side note, no one is required to make a PCB for the class, I wanted to make one since I enjoy doing so and to make the project look more professional. It looks messy, now imagine how it would look without a custom PCB.</p>

                    <img class="img-rounded img-responsive visible-fadeIn" src="images/laser_cnc/stepper.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <img class="img-rounded img-responsive visible-fadeIn" src="images/laser_cnc/rail.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <p class="visible-fadeIn">The stepper motors I used are very precise, 400 steps per revolution. The limiting factor in this equation is the drive system that I have used. As pictured above I am using belts. They are precise, but not 400 steps per revolution precise. After some research, there is no way to obtain the resolution unless you use a gear system instead of belts.</p>
                    <br>
                    <img class="img-rounded img-responsive visible-fadeIn" src="images/laser_cnc/laser_head.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <p class="visible-fadeIn">Now the lost precision due to the belt system is saddening, worry not, the laser is a bigger bottle neck. Even if you were able to obtain the precision from the drive system, focusing the laser to a needle head size is almost impossible withot specialized tuning. Given all the bad sides of the whole setup, it might sound that the project is a waste of money, it was not. The precision I am talking about is so precise that a human could not notice it without specialized tools. The way the laser is tuned I could get it to print 12mil traces on a PCB. I have not yet tried to make a PCB using the UV method, but given the parameters of the laser, I believe it would work very well. </p>
                    <p class="visible-fadeIn">The laser is a powerful 2 Watt 442nm beast. It will burn through a lot of things, including your Cornea and Pupil. Always wear safety goggles when working with these and never look straight at the laser. They are fascinating and dangerous at the same time.</p>
                    <p class="visible-fadeIn">The massive heatsink is in place in order to cool down the laser. It is much of an overkill but I had a spare computer CPU heatsink that I would never use anyway so it was the perfect thing to use. I drilled a hole for the laser module, glued it in place using heat conductive glue and attached it to the rail. A little hackish but it does the job just right.</p>

                    <img class="img-rounded img-responsive visible-fadeIn" src="images/laser_cnc/PCB.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <p class="visible-fadeIn">The PCB has 4 buttons for control of the menu. There is an LCD attached through the headers seen here. The main chip is the Atmega328p running on Arduino code. The class required that the machine be stand alone thus there is no FTDI on board to save cost and board space. There is a micro SD card on the back of the board. The SD card is used to store files which had the instructions for the Laser CNC. I made a program for PC which converted bitmap images to 0's and 1's. The file would then be read by the microcontroller and approperiate action would be taken but more on that in the Software section. Also the voltage regulator was a bit beefy in order to have the LCD powered from this board. Also, since this PCB was done in Fritzing and since Fritzing does not support 45 degree traces too well thus it was challenging to make them nice.</p>
