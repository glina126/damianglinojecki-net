                  The laser CNC was born as a long dreamed project which finally had an excuse to pop out. It was built for my mbeded systems class which required an Arduino based hardware project. I came up with this project as it would render as a very useful tool for building all sorts of contraptions out of wood, paper or other light material. The laser turned out to be really great, especially due to the precision that I could obtain and the power of the laser.

                    QMBT BIG is a custom hardware and custm software Arduino based quadcopter. This project was a product of many smaller quadcopters that I have tried to build and make. It had a very steep learning curve, all the way from filters to Control loops such as the PID algorithm. This project has changed its gears to a much better fit microcontroler.

                    QMBT <small>small</small> was born a very long time ago, long before I could dream to design circuits in my sleep. This project was a big push in my self development. It has encouraged me to learn circuit design and custom PCBs. The very first board I have made was for this particular project. It was not the best, but it has enabled me to learn further and come to where I am right now. It has a lot of sentimental value as it has been with me on the journey for a very long time and it is still here and well.

                    Arduinos these days take various shapes and sizes. I looked at everything available in the market, and they all had one thing in common; 2.54mm header spacing. This bothered me as it was very often uncessary for such thick wires. It also made the Arduinos big, bulky and actually pricey due to their size. I looked at the available components and set out to build the smallest, yet just as powerful of an Arduino as the UNO. It has became my goal, and this goal is almost there, almost.

                    Not all my projects are as big as the ones above, and not all of them deserve a spot on the front page, though they are not to be forgotten or thrown away. Whenever you finish a design and send it off to the fab house, it would be a waste to just sit around. This is where these projects come in. Also, sometimes you need a break from a particular project, well again, this is where these projects come in. They are mostly, quick and small. Some of them, dirty.
